# Core Rules
#### v1.3

---

**If Worlds Collide** is a skirmish wargame set among shattered worlds and realities. It is designed to be a toolbox rather than one defined world. The overarching setting pits players against each other to understand the mirrored cracks in reality. As fissures occur, worlds start to bleed into one another, cultures and civilizations meet for the first time, and conflicts arise. But this is just a spark, not the final destination.

The game is played with 10 to 20 models per player, with no particular miniature line; any and all levels of magic, technology and even different time periods can be played together. The focus of the game is on narrative gameplay with memorable and exciting moments. Games are designed to be completed within 1.5 hours for two players.

## Stuff you Need

* A tabletop or surface to play the game on. Suggested size is 3’ by 3’ square, or larger.
* Several pieces of terrain for blocking line-of-sight and creating an interesting play surface.
* A set of six sided dice of various colors.
* A set of miniatures to play with for each player. Each individual miniature model is referred to as a unit.

## Reading the Rules

Whenever rules are unclear, use your common sense and personal preference and move on! If any rules conflicts directly with another, apply the more specifically worded rule as a priority.

## Playing the Game

To start, lay out the board and terrain and decide on deployment zones. Deployment zones will be sections of the board where players start putting down units. See the Mission section for guidance on setting up deployment zones and objectives.

Roll to see who starts deploying units first.

To begin the game, deploy units one at a time alternating between the players. Once both players have all their units deployed, the game starts.

A game is played in 5 **rounds**, win conditions are determined by scenario objectives.

Each **round** happens in 3 steps:

1. **ENVIRONMENT STEP** Players roll off (1d6) to determine which player’s Environment effect is enabled that round.
  * The winner of the roll then rolls another 1d6 to determine the Environment effect that will be enabled that round. Environment effects are listed on the player’s faction page.
  * Optionally: If you want to, you can use a shuffled set of 12 cards (6 from each player) instead of rolling dice and looking up the results in the faction table. You will need to source a deck of cards representing each faction's environmental effects to play this way.

2. **ACTIVATION POINTS GAINED** Each player earns 2 activation points by default, and additional points based on their current leader(s) leadership score. Multiple leaders can be used by a single player, in which case, the points are added cumulatively.
  * Activation points not used in a round are carried over to future rounds.
  * After gaining activation points at the start of the round, the player with the LOWEST value of accumulated points goes first. Resolve ties with a dice roll.
  * Each unit activation uses up ONE activation point. In addition, activation points may be used to re-roll failed knack checks. Each re-roll uses up ONE activation point.

3. **ALTERNATE ACTIVATIONS** Players alternate unit activations until they either run out of units, run out of activations, or decide to stop and save their points for later rounds.

## Environment Effects

Each player will have a table of Environment effects listed on their faction page. In the Environment step, one of these effects will be selected that affects both players.

Each card will have:

1. An active effect, which is enabled as soon as the round starts.
1. A penalty for failing a tactic knack check. See Using Tactics below.

Both the active effect and the tactic failed penalty apply for both players that round, but may be skewed or in favor for the faction the Environment effect originated from.

## Activations

On an activation, the player may choose to activate a single unit, or multiple units as a formation. When activating a formation of units, the units must be within base contact (with allowances for wide miniatures) of each other and have the same training. Training is a set of faction specific tags that decide what units can activate together in formation.

Sometimes, a unit may specify a specific formation pattern on the unit sheet, which should be followed to be able to activate the units together.

If a leader is a part of the formation, you may combine multiple different units with different training for the activation. As long as all the units are within base contact with each other, they can activate together with the leader.

As part of the activation, the units(s) may move up to their full movement value, and then attack with all valid weapons.

Alternatively, they may first attack with all weapons and then move. Movement cannot be broken into two parts.

If moving as part of a formation, the units must stay together in formation at the end of their movement as well.

Instead of attacking with all weapons, the unit may choose to make an additional movement.

### Using Tactics

Before activating your unit(s), decide if you want to use a tactic for the activation. Select an tactic from your faction sheet and roll an knack check trying to meet or exceed the knack score for the tactic selected.

If successful, the effects apply for the rest of that activation. If the knack check is failed, you suffer the penalties listed in the current active Environment effect.

You then continue to activate your unit(s) after applying the boon or penalty.

### Attacks

#### Choosing a Target
Activated units choose a target for EACH attack, prior to rolling. Each unit (if activating as a formation) as well as each weapon of a unit may be aimed at a different target.

For weapons with melee type, targets must be within approximate base contact to be chosen. For cases where you want to attack a unit above or below you on a platform, but there is no space to manouver your miniature within base contact, you may assume that your unit moved within reach if it has the movement score to reach the target vertically.

For weapons with the ranged type, targets must be chosen such that they are within line of sight. A target is within line of sight if it is clearly visible from the point of view of the attacker.

#### Line of Sight and Cover

If there are any obstacles that obscure most of the target from view, including other models, then the unit cannot be chosen as the target for a ranged attack.

If the target is partially obscured, but still visible then the targeted unit receives an additional defensive bonus of [Physical 3]. That is, the value 3 is added to the score of the unit’s existing defense value, as well as adding the physical type to the unit’s existing defense types.

#### Knack Roll

To land each attack, the player will roll a six sided die for each attack, attempting to match the knack score for the weapon being used, listed on the unit’s stat block. Unmodified rolls of 1 always fail, and rolls of 6 always hit.

If the unit is only attacking one target, you may roll all dice at the same time.

If the unit is attacking multiple targets, roll the dice for each given target separately, in the order you want to resolve them.

If a die roll matches the knack score or higher, the attack lands and damage is inflicted to the unit’s hit points based on the damage value of the weapon, modified by the defense value of the target.

Some weapons are more effective against certain defense types. If the weapon used is effective against the defense type of the target unit, then the damage characteristic of the weapon is DOUBLED. In the case where the target has more than one defense type, the weapon must be effective against ALL the types to double the damage.

All attacks that land will deal a minimum of 1 damage, even if the defense value of the target would reduce the damage to zero.

When a unit is reduced to zero hit points, it is removed from play, and replaced with a token signifying a fallen unit. Alternatively, if you don’t have access to any tokens, the miniature may be placed on it’s side instead to represent the token.

#### Ranged Weapons in Melee Combat

If a unit currently  has an enemy within base contact, or melee weapons range: ALL knack checks involving exclusively ranged weapons must roll unmodified values of 6 to be successful.

### Abilities

Units may have abilities which are specific to them. The ability will specify how it is to be used and any costs they incur. Some abilities may specify that the unit cannot move or attack that activation. Some may deal damage to the unit or incur penalties on them. Abilities may supersede the rules in some fashion.

### Tokens

Some abilities and effects cause tokens to be placed on the battlefield. These tokens are always 1 inch in diameter, unless otherwise specified. Tokens can block line of sight and provide cover, just like any unit or terrain feature.

### Conditions

Some abilities, tactics, or environment effects can cause units to gain or lose conditions. These will persist for the duration specified when the condition is gained, and can be cleared with any effects that say they interact with conditions. Conditions can have positive or negative effects.

### Terrain

Other than blocking line of sight, terrain imparts other benefits as well. By default, all terrain has the following traits:

* If a piece of terrain partially obscures a unit during an attack, (50% or more), units gain the benefit of cover bonus.
* Terrain is scalable, costing movement in the vertical direction to ascend and descend.
