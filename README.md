# Core Rules
#### v1.4

---

**If Worlds Collide** is a skirmish wargame set among shattered worlds and realities. It is designed to be a toolbox rather than one defined world. The overarching setting pits players against each other to understand the mirrored cracks in reality. As fissures occur, worlds start to bleed into one another, cultures and civilizations meet for the first time, and conflicts arise. But this is just a spark, not the final destination.

The game is played with 10 to 20 models per player, with no particular miniature line; any and all levels of magic, technology and even different time periods can be played together. The focus of the game is on narrative gameplay with memorable and exciting moments. Games are designed to be completed within 1.5 hours for two players.

## Dimensions

The game may be played in any scale and with any measurement system. Distances are defined as unitless values of d (eg: 23d), which can be scaled/converted to your choosing. A simple rule of thumb for playing in 1:56 (standard 25/32mm) is 1d is equal to 1 inch, or 1d is equal to 25mm.

## Stuff you Need

* A tabletop or surface to play the game on. A 36d by 36d square, or ~1300d squared rectangle.
* Several pieces of terrain for blocking line-of-sight and creating an interesting play surface.
* A set of six sided dice of various colors.
* A set of miniatures to play with for each player. Each individual miniature model is referred to as a unit.
* A way to measure distance. Ruler/Measuring Tape.

## Reading the Rules

Whenever rules are unclear, use your common sense and personal preference and move on! If any rules conflicts directly with another, apply the more specifically worded rule as a priority.

## Playing the Game

Before you start playing decide on a point limit with your opponent and build rosters that are equivalent in value. Recommended you start with a 150 point limit for your first game, and go from there.

To start, lay out the board and terrain and decide on deployment zones. Deployment zones will be sections of the board where players start putting down units. See the Mission section for guidance on setting up deployment zones and objectives.

Roll to see who starts deploying units first.

To begin the game, deploy units one at a time alternating between the players. Once both players have all their units deployed, the game starts.

A game is played in 5 **rounds**, win conditions are determined by scenario objectives.

[List of Scenarios](https://github.com/knarbmakes/ifworldscollide/blob/main/missions/first_contact.md)

Each **round** happens in 3 steps:

1. **ENVIRONMENT STEP** Players roll off (1d6) to determine which player’s Environment effect is enabled that round.
  * The winner of the roll then rolls another 1d6 to determine the Environment effect that will be enabled that round. Environment effects are listed on the player’s faction page.
  * Optionally: If you want to, you can use a shuffled set of 12 cards (6 from each player) instead of rolling dice and looking up the results in the faction table. You will need to source a deck of cards representing each faction's environmental effects to play this way.

2. **ACTIVATION POINTS GAINED** Each player earns 2 AP (Activation Points) by default, and additional points based on their current leader(s) leadership score. Multiple leaders can be used by a single player, in which case, the points are added cumulatively.
  * AP not used in a round are carried over to future rounds.
  * After gaining AP at the start of the round, the player with the LOWEST value of accumulated points goes first. Resolve ties with a dice roll.
  * You spend ONE AP each time you want to activate either one or multiple units together (see Formations below)
  * Each individual unit may only be activated once per round.
  * In addition, AP may be used to re-roll failed knack checks. Each re-roll uses up ONE AP.

3. **ALTERNATE ACTIVATIONS** Players alternate unit activations until they either run out of units to activate, run out of AP, or decide to stop and save their points for later rounds.

## Environment Effects

Each player will have a table of Environment effects listed on their faction page. In the Environment step, one of these effects will be selected that affects both players.

Each card will have:

1. An active effect, which is enabled as soon as the round starts.
1. A penalty for failing a tactic knack check. See Using Tactics below.

Both the active effect and the tactic failed penalty apply for both players that round, but may be skewed or in favor for the faction the Environment effect originated from.

## Activations

On an activation, the player may choose to activate a single unit, or multiple units as a Formation. 

### Formations and Training

When activating a Formation of units, the units must be within base contact (with allowances for wide miniatures) of each other and have the same training. Training is a set of faction specific tags that decide what units can activate together in formation.

If a leader is a part of the Formation, you may combine multiple units with different training types for the activation. As long as all the units are within base contact with each other, they can activate together with the leader.

### Using Tactics

At the beginning of each activation, before any movement, attacks or abilities, the player may choose a single tactic to use. Select an tactic from your faction sheet and roll an knack check trying to meet or exceed the knack score for the tactic selected.

If successful, the effects apply for the rest of that activation to all activated units. If the knack check is failed, you suffer the penalties listed in the current active Environment effect.

After applying the boon or penalty as needed, you may continue to take your unit(s) actions.

### Unit Actions

As part of the activation, the units(s) may move up to their full movement value, attack with all weapons, and use all their abilities.

Attacks and Movement cannot be broken up in multiple parts, but may be done in any order. Eg: Attack then Move, or Move then Attack.

Abilities can be used at any time during the turn, as long as they do not break up Attacks or Movement.

Instead of attacking with all weapons, the unit may choose to make an additional movement, also referred to as a double move.

When moving a formation, the units must start AND end their overall movement in base contact.

### Movement

Units may move freely through friendly units, but not through enemy units. Terrain may also block movement, and must either be scaled vertically or circumvented around, both costing additional movement. Use common sense in terms of measuring micro-details, keep the game moving.

### Attacks

#### Choosing a Target

Activated units choose a target for EACH attack, prior to rolling.

Each unit (if activating as a formation) as well as each weapon of a unit may be aimed at different targets if desired.

#### Weapon Types

Some weapons work differently than others. A weapon may have more than one type listed, which allows you some flexibility on which targeting feature or penalty to take.

**Melee** - This weapon may target adjacent units for attacks.

**Near** - This weapon may be used to target any units within line of sight, and within 10d.

**Ranged** - This weapon may be used to target any units within line of sight, at any distance. However, while an enemy unit threatens it within melee, all ranged attacks using Ranged targeting are less accurate, requiring unmodified knack rolls of 6 to hit successfully.

**Heavy** - This weapon specializes in dealing large amounts of damage, penetrating even the strongest defense. For attacks where the target's defenses would reduce the damage to 0, Heavy weapons always deals a minimum of 2 damage for each successful attack. Additionally, Heavy weapons MUST be defined with 6 or more base damage per attack.

#### Line of Sight and Cover

If there are any obstacles that obscure the target from view, including other models (friend or foe), then the unit cannot be chosen as the target for a ranged attack. To determine if a unit is visible or obscured, draw an imaginary line from the center of the source unit to any point of the target unit. If a line exists that is un-interrupted, then the unit is visible.

If the target is partially obscured, that is: from the center of the source unit, there are lines that are interrupted and un-interrupted, then the target unit gains the benefit of cover defense [Physical 3]. That is, the value 3 is added to the score of the unit’s existing defense value, as well as adding the physical Defense Type to the unit’s existing Defense Types.

#### Knack Roll

Knack rolls are used for determining success for weapons, abilities, knack checks and other effects.

To determine success, the player rolls a six sided die for each attack and applies any bonuses or penalties to the value, attempting to match the knack score for the weapon being used. Unmodified rolls of 1 always fail, and rolls of 6 always hit.

If the unit is only attacking one target, you may roll all dice at the same time.

If the unit is attacking multiple targets, roll the dice for each given target separately, in the order you want to resolve them. If a die roll matches the knack score or higher, the attack lands and damage is inflicted.

Knack checks for ability and tactic use work in a similar way.

#### Calculating Damage

Attack damage is calculated individually, per attack.

For each successful attack or source of damage, take the damage value, apply all bonuses and then apply all penalties from the defense value of the unit taking damage, in that order.

Damage is modified in several ways:

**Target Unit Defense Value** - Subtracted from the incoming damage.

**Target Unit Defense Type** - Some units specify one or more Defense Types. These types are a protection against CRITICAL damage.

**CRITICAL Attacks** - If an attack bypasses ALL Defense Types a unit has, it is considered a CRITICAL attack and does double damage (doubling is applied before subtracting defense value, as this is a bonus to the attack). If the attack has any other damage bonuses, they are also doubled by the CRITICAL.

For example:

> A Berserker is attacking a Scientist with an Axe (A3 D6). 
> The weapon hits with 2 attack, with base 6 damage each.
> The Scientist has a Defense Value of 1 and the Reactive Defense Type. Therefore, we subtract 1 from the incoming damage, for a result of 5 hit points on the unit for each attack.
> 
> If the Axe was able to bypass the Scientist's Reactive Defense Type OR the Scientist had no Defense Types listed, the attack would be CRITICAL, inflicting (12 - 1) damage for 11 hit points on the unit for each attack.

When a unit is reduced to zero hit points, it is removed from play, and replaced with a corpse or other token signifying the fallen unit. Some units drop different types of tokens on death, as specified on their stat sheet.

#### Melee and Movement Penalty

In addition to limiting the accuracy of ranged weapons, when an enemy unit is within melee range, your unit suffers from limited mobility. Activating a unit that has enemy units within melee range limits you to either attacking or moving, but not both. Ability use is unaffected.

### Abilities

Units may have any number of abilities they can use during an activation. The ability text will specify how it is to be used and any costs they incur.

Most abilities will require some form of knack check, which works identical to weapon attacks. Some abilities take the form of passive bonuses or require some sort of trigger, others are targeted effects.

Abilities may supersede the rules in some fashion.

### Tokens

Some abilities and effects cause tokens to be placed on the battlefield. These tokens are always 1d in diameter, unless otherwise specified. Tokens can block line of sight and provide cover, just like any unit or terrain feature.

### Conditions

Some abilities, tactics, or environment effects can cause units to gain or lose conditions. These will persist for the duration specified when the condition is gained, and can be cleared with any effects that say they interact with conditions. Conditions can have positive or negative effects.
