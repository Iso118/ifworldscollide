# First Contact
> Symmetric Objective Control with Strategic Resources

Two months ago, the new and terrible horrors of the universe manifested themselves onto Sigmund Five, an outer planet in the Cromaggon system. Nobody knows why or how, but the minings outposts all over the planet have been shut down as alien incursions have advanced across the planet.

The mining of Carmide Glass has come to a halt as strange portals have appeared near concetrations of the material. This material seems to be fueling rips in the universe as we know it. Can you harness their power?

## Factions
This scenario pits the two factions against one another as they try and gain control over the portals popping up for their own purposes.

## Map

This is an example layout, place 5 portals randomly distributed on the board. You may take turns placing these with your opponent before the game begins.

## Starting Deployment

Roll off to see who picks first depoyment. The winner chooses one portal, and starts deploying units within 6 inches of it, while their opponent does the same from any other portal. Alternate placing units until they are all on the board.

## Objectives & Win Condition

The portals are the objectives for the game, and are a way to generate victory points.

At the end of each round, players gain 1 victory point for each portal they control. To control a portal, you must have a unit within 3 inches of the portal, without any enemy units contesting it.

First player to reach 12 victory points or the player with the most points at the end of the 5th round, wins the game.

## Portal Mechanics

A Portal can do more than just earn victory points. All portals controlled by your faction work together, and may be used for teleporting your troops through them. Once per activation, you may move any unit within 3 inches of a portal to anywhere within 3 inches of another controlled portal.

Portals that are in contest, or enemy portals cannot be teleported to.

Additonally, a controlled portal may be destroyed by spending 2 activation points while you are activating a unit near the portal. Doing so awards you with 2 victory points immediately, but removes the portal from play for the rest of the game.
