# First Contact
> Symmetric Objective Control with Strategic Resources

Two months ago, the new and terrible horrors of the universe manifested themselves onto Sigmund Five, an outer planet in the Cromaggon system. Nobody knows why or how, but the minings outposts all over the planet have been shut down as alien incursions have advanced across the planet.

The mining of Carmide Glass has come to a halt as strange portals have appeared near concetrations of the material. This material seems to be fueling rips in the universe as we know it. Can you harness their power?

## Factions
This scenario pits the two factions:
- Order of the Broken Mirror (in blue)
- Crimson Castellan (in red)

As they seek to gain control over the portal energy for their own purposes.
You may substitute another faction in place of blue or red.

## Objectives & Win Condition

5 Portals are placed around the map as shown. These are the objectives for the game, and an additional way to generate activation points.

At the end of each round, players gain 1 activation point for each portal they control. To control a portal, you must have a unit within 3 inches of the portal, without any enemy units contesting it.

The player with the most controlled portals at the end of the fifth round wins. In the case of a tie, the player with the most activation points wins.

## Deployment

Chosing one portal, each faction may deploy their forces within a 6 inch radius around it. This is their incursion point into the universe.
