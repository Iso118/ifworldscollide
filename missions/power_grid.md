# Power Grid
> Symmetric Objective Control with High Risk / Rewards

To survive a jaunt through the Rift was known to be a harrowing feat, but to navigate the Rift, to design one's own trajectory while hurdling through the kaleidoscopic nexus of all existence, was thought as an impossible one. Yet time and again, beings of incredible power attempted to harness the Rift's omnipotence, with horrifying and catastrophic results. Folly led only to more folly, and hubris only to even greater hubris, until one race of supreme beings exceeded all other attempts. Their names were unknown, and their forms nigh imperceptible, but the artifacts that they crafted became legendary even to the most fringe dimensions.

The Loci of Power, it was said, were able to generate and hold an immense grid of energy, one strong enough to cut a clear and stable path through the Rift. This legend, and its promise of power, was the catalyst for a grand pilgrimage into the Rifts from all corners of existence, one painted with violence and strife, as each reality sought the home world of the supreme beings. 

Whether by fate, or sheer chance, your forces have happened upon the supreme beings' Artifactory, and the Loci of Power lay before you! And yet, it appears a dimensional rival has done the same. What price will you pay for power? What price will you pay, to control the grid?

## Factions
This scenario pits the two factions against one another as they try and gain control over the three Loci of Power.

## Map

This mission uses a standard 36 x 36 map, the above is an example layout. Place 3 Loci of Power, distributed evenly along the center of the board.

## Starting Deployment

The map is split diagonally into two deployment zones. In the exmaple map above, the divide runs from the top left of the map to bottom right. 

Players roll off using 1d6, re-rolling on ties. The highest roll gets to choose which zone they will deploy in, and will also provide the Environmental Effect in the first round of play. Players take turns deploying formations of any size in their respective zones, but cannot deploy within 3 steps of a Locus of Power. Once both players have deployed all their units per their factions' rules, play begins.

## Objectives & Win Condition

The Loci of Power are the objectives for the game, and are a way to generate Victory Points (VP) and bonus Activation Points (AP).

At the end of each round, players gain 1 VP for each Locus of Power they control. A Locus comes under your control if you have units within a 3 step radius without any enemy units in the same 3 step radius.

The game lasts 5 rounds, or until one faction has no units on the battlefield. The player with the most VP at the end of the 5th round, or with the only faction on the battlefield, wins the game.

## Loci of Power Mechanics

The Loci of Power can do more than just earn Victory Points, if players are willing to play boldly. In addition to the normal 2 Activation Points earned in the Logistics Phase, players earn...
 - 1 AP if they control the Locus in their own deployment zone
 - 2 AP if they control the neutral Locus
 - 3 AP if they control the Locus in the enemy's deployment zone

Loci that are in contest do not provide bonus AP

Additonally, the central Locus of Power has been the site of much experimentation, and thus provides strange and volatile benefits to those who control it. At the end of the Logistics Phase, before activation orders are decided based on AP, the player who controls the neutral Locus of Power may roll 1d6 and immediately gain the bonus effect listed below...
 - If the result of the roll is 1 or 2, you may pay 1 AP to re-roll the Environmental Effect using the same faction table. 
 - If the result of the roll is 3 or 4, you may pay up to 2 AP to remove twice that many tokens from the battlefield.
 - If the result of the roll is 5 or 6, you may pay up to 3 AP to gain that many bonus VP. 
 
The player who controls the neutral Locus of Power may also choose not to roll for a new effect and instead may gain whatever effect was last rolled. If no effect has been rolled, they gain no bonus benefit.
