# The Long Road Home
> Escort or Kill VIP Unit

The collapse of reality leaves plenty of wreckage in its wake, and the rifts care little about
collateral damage. A fissure in the universe just spat out two sentient robots from a distant
dimension, and a yawning portal remains.

According to RedBot, BlueBot is carrying a weapon
capable of vast devastation, which RedBot promises to his allied faction.

According to BlueBot,
he carries a device which can provide his people with the energy needed to stabilize their world
and he promises to share some of this energy with his allied faction if they can escort him to the
portal.
