# Last Chance
## The Situation.
Some things can never be tamed, a lesson hard learned and frequently forgotten. The latest victim of this is the ruined Trinity Research Station on Ypsilon Prime. They aimed to use the destabilizing effects of the portals to enable faster than light travel. They were not successful. Now all that stands is ruins and scavengers lurking nearby to harvest what they can of its corpse. They hope they can use the information to do the work right next time. The fools. The initial rage may have subsided, but the "experiment" is still alive and ready to lash at anyone.

## The Rules
Standard 5 round game. Any unit within the inner circle structure can forgo their attack action in order to make a Knack 3 test to try to scavenge information and score a point. At most 3 points can be scored by a team in a given round. At the end of every round, every unit within the inner circle suffers 4 damage.

Fist person to reach 7 points wins. In the event that a player loses all their units, the game immediately ends, and the person with the highest point count wins (even if they lost all their units).

If the game reaches the end of round 5 without a winner, the person with the most points wins.
